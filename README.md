# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for Rocket Landing

The goal is to train a reinforcement learning agent to control a rocket to either hover or land safely using the PPO algorithm. The environment simulates physics for the rocket, and the agent learns to make decisions based on the state observations to achieve the task.

### Actions

The rocket can take different actions, each defined by a thrust force and nozzle angular velocity. The available actions are:

1. **Thrust Levels**: Controls the rocket’s thrust, with options:
   - **0.2 × g**
   - **1.0 × g**
   - **2.0 × g**
   
2. **Nozzle Angular Velocities**: Controls the rotation of the rocket nozzle, with options:
   - **0** (No rotation)
   - **+30°/s**
   - **-30°/s**

These combinations result in a set of **9 actions**:

| Action | Thrust | Nozzle Angular Velocity |
|--------|--------|-------------------------|
| 0      | 0.2 g  | 0                       |
| 1      | 0.2 g  | +30°/s                  |
| 2      | 0.2 g  | -30°/s                  |
| 3      | 1.0 g  | 0                       |
| 4      | 1.0 g  | +30°/s                  |
| 5      | 1.0 g  | -30°/s                  |
| 6      | 2.0 g  | 0                       |
| 7      | 2.0 g  | +30°/s                  |
| 8      | 2.0 g  | -30°/s                  |

### States

The state of the rocket environment is represented by an **8-dimensional vector**, capturing essential details for controlling the rocket. Each component of the state vector is normalized:

- **x**: Horizontal position (m)
- **y**: Vertical position (m)
- **vx**: Horizontal velocity (m/s)
- **vy**: Vertical velocity (m/s)
- **θ (theta)**: Rocket’s angle relative to the vertical (radians)
- **vθ (vtheta)**: Angular velocity of the rocket (radians/s)
- **t**: Simulation time (steps)
- **φ (phi)**: Nozzle angle (radians)

These states provide the necessary information for the agent to understand the rocket's position, orientation, and dynamics, which are essential for executing successful hovering or landing maneuvers.

## Mathematical Background

### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

PPO is a policy gradient method for reinforcement learning, which alternates between sampling data through interaction with the environment and optimizing a "surrogate" objective function using stochastic gradient ascent.

### Neural Network Architecture

#### Actor Network

- Takes state \( s_t \) as input.
- Outputs action probabilities (discrete actions) or action means (continuous actions).
- For discrete action spaces, applies a Softmax activation to output probabilities.

#### Critic Network

- Takes state \( s_t \) as input.
- Outputs a single value estimate \( V(s_t) \).

### Action Selection

- **Discrete Actions**: Sampled from a Categorical distribution based on action probabilities.
- **Continuous Actions**: Sampled from a Multivariate Normal distribution with mean and variance from the actor network.

### Gradient Computation

- Gradients are computed with respect to the loss function.
- The optimizer updates the network parameters to minimize the loss.
